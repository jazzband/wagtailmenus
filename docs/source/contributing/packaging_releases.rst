Release packaging guidelines

Preparing for a new release
===========================

Follow the steps outlined below to prep changes in your fork:

1.  Merge any changes from ``upstream/master`` into your fork's ``master``
    branch.

    .. code-block:: console

        git fetch upstream
        git checkout master
        git merge upstream/master

2.  From your fork's ``master`` branch, create a new branch for prepping the
    release, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: console

        git checkout -b release-prep/2.X.X

3.  Update ``__version__`` in ``wagtailmenus/__init__.py`` to reflect the new
    release version.

4.  Make sure ``CHANGELOG.md`` is updated with details of any changes since
    the last release.

5.  Make sure the release notes for the new version have been created /
    updated in ``docs/source/releases/`` and are referenced in 
    ``docs/source/releases/index.rst``. Be sure to remove the '(alpha)' or 
    '(beta)' from the heading in the latest release notes, as well as the
    'Wagtailmenus X.X is in the alpha stage of development' just below.

6.  If releasing a 'final' version, following an 'alpha' or 'beta' release, 
    ensure the ``a`` or ``b`` is removed from the file name for the release, 
    and the reference to it in ``docs/source/releases/index.rst``.

7.  Check that the docs build okay, and fix any errors raised by sphinx:

    .. code-block:: console

        make html

8.  Commit changes so far:

    .. code-block:: console
    
        git commit -am 'Bumped version and updated release notes'
       
8.  Update the source translation files by running the following from the
    project's root directory:

    .. code-block:: console

        # Update source files
        django-admin.py makemessages -l en

        # Commit the changes
        git commit -am 'Update source translation files'

9.  Push all oustanding changes to github:

    .. code-block:: console
    
        git push

10. Submit your changes as a PR to the main repo via
    https://github.com/rkhleics/wagtailmenus/compare


Packaging and pushing to PyPi
=============================

When satisfied with the PR for prepping the files:

1.  From https://github.com/rkhleics/wagtailmenus/pulls, merge the PR into the
    ``master`` branch using the "merge commit" option.

2.  Locally, cd to the project's root directory, checkout the ``master``
    branch, and ensure the local copy is up-to-date: 

    .. code-block:: console
        
        workon wagtailmenus
        cd ../path-to-original-repo
        git checkout master
        git pull

3.  Ensure dependencies are up-to-date by running:

    .. code-block:: console

        pip install -e '.[testing,docs]' -U

4.  Push any updated translation source files to Transifex:

    .. code-block:: console

        tx push -s -l en

5.  Pull down updated translations from Transifex:

    .. code-block:: console

        tx pull --a
        rm -r wagtailmenus/locale/en_GB/
        git add *.po

6.  Convert the .po files to .mo for each language by running:
    
    .. code-block:: console

         find . -name \*.po -execdir msgfmt django.po -o django.mo \;

7.  Commit and push all changes so far:
    
    .. code-block:: console

        git commit -am 'Pulled updated translations from Transifex and converted to .mo'
        git push

8.  Create a new tag for the new version and push that too:

    .. code-block:: console
        
        git tag -a v2.X.X
        git push --tags

9.  Create a new source distribution and universal wheel for the new version

    .. code-block:: console

        python setup.py sdist
        python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal

10. Install twine (if not already installed) and upload to the new distribution
    files to the PyPi test environment.
    
    .. code-block:: console
        
        pip install twine
        twine upload dist/* -r pypitest

11. Test that the new test distribution installs okay:

    .. code-block:: console

        mktmpenv
        pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi wagtailmenus
        deactivate

12. If all okay, push distribution files to the live PyPi:

    .. code-block:: console

        twine upload dist/* -r pypi

13. Edit the release notes for the release from
    https://github.com/rkhleics/wagtailmenus/releases, by copying and pasting
    the content from ``docs/releases/x.x.x.rst``

14. Crack open a beer - you earned it!
