What's new?
===========

TBA


Minor changes & bug fixes 
=========================

- Added support for Wagtail 2.3.
- Added support for Wagtail 2.4.
- Added support for Django 2.1.
- Minor documentation updates (OktayAltay).
- Updated ``MenuPage.get_repeated_menu_item()`` to nullify ``sub_menu`` on the copy to reduce likelihood of infinite recursion errors.
- Updated ``Menu._prime_menu_item()`` to set ``sub_menu`` to None if no new value is being added, to reduce likelihood of infinite recursion errors.
- Updated ``SectionMenu.prepare_to_render()`` to augment ``root_page`` with 'text', 'href' and 'active_class' attributes, so that it no longer has to be done in ``SectionMenu.get_context_data()``.


Deprecations
============

TBA


Upgrade considerations
======================

Following a standard deprecation period a two minor releases, the following functionality has now been removed.


``relative_url()`` methods must accept a ``request`` keyword argument
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using custom ``MenuItem`` models in your project, and are overriding ``relative_url()``, you should update the signature on your custom model method to accept a ``request`` keyword argument, and pass it on to ``link_page.relative_url()`` and ``super().relative_url()`` (in addition to ``site``) if calling either of those from.
