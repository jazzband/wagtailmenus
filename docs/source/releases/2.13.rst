Upgrade considerations
======================

Following a standard deprecation period a two minor releases, the following functionality has now been removed.


``relative_url()`` methods must accept a ``request`` keyword argument
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using custom ``MenuItem`` models in your project, and are overriding ``relative_url()``, you should update the signature on your custom model method to accept a ``request`` keyword argument, and pass it on to ``link_page.relative_url()`` and ``super().relative_url()`` (in addition to ``site``) if calling either of those from.
