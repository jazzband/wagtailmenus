Wagtailmenus 2.3.2 release notes
================================

This is a maintenance release to fix a bug that was resulting in 
``{% sub_menu %}`` being called recursively (until raising a "maximum
recursion depth exceeded" exception) if a 'repeated menu item' was added at
anything past the second level. Thanks to @pyMan for raising/investigating.
