================================
Wagtailmenus 2.2.3 release notes
================================

This is a maintenence release to fix a bug that was resulting in 
``{% sub_menu %}`` being called recursively (until raising a "maximum
recursion depth exceeded" exception) if a 'repeated menu item' was added at
anything past the 2nd level. Thanks to @pyMan for raising/investigating.
