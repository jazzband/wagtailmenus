Wagtailmenus 2.1.2 release notes
================================

This is a maintenance release to fix a bug that was preventing reordered menu
items from retaining their new order after saving (the ``Meta`` class on the 
new abstract models had knocked out the ``sort_order`` ordering from ``wagtail.wagtailcore.models.Orderable``).
