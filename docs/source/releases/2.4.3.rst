Wagtailmenus 2.4.3 release notes
================================

This is a maintenance release to fix a bug that was resulting in Django creating additional migrations for the app when running the  ``makemigrations`` command after changing the project's default language to something other than "en".

Thanks to @philippbosch from A Color Bright for submitting the fix.
