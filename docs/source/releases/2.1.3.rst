Wagtailmenus 2.1.3 release notes
================================

This is a maintenence release to fix a bug in the ``section_menu tag`` that
arose when attempting to apply the correct active class to ``section_root`` when the ``modify_submenu_items()`` method has been overridden to return additional items without an ``active_class`` attribute (like in the example code in README)
