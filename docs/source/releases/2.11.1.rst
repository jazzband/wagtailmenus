Wagtailmenus 2.11.1 release notes
=================================

This is a minor release to solve a few non code-related issues:

- Fixed an issue with the section menu in the release notes section of the docs.
- Updated tox config to test against Python 3.7 and Wagtail 2.2
- Updated Travis CI config to deploy to PyPi automatically when commits are tagged appropriately.
- Pinned django-cogwheels dependency to version 0.2 to reduce potential for backwards-incompatibility issues.
