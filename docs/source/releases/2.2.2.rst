Wagtailmenus 2.2.2 release notes
================================

This is a maintenance release to improve general code quality and make project 
management easier. There are no compatibility issues to worry about.

What's changed?
===============

* Update codebase to better handle situations where ``request`` isn't available in the context when rendering, or ``request.site`` hasn't been set.
* Got the project set up in Transifex (finally!): https://www.transifex.com/jazzband/wagtailmenus/
* Updated translatable strings throughout the project to use named variable substitution, and unmarked a few exception messages.
* Added Lithuanian translations (submitted by Matas Dailyda).
