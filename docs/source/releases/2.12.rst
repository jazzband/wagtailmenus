Deprecations
============

TBA


Upgrade considerations
======================

Following a standard deprecation period a two minor releases, the following functionality has now been removed.


The WAGTAILMENUS_CHILDREN_MENU_CLASS_PATH setting is no longer supported
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using this to override the menu class used to render children menus in your project, you'll need to update your Django settings to use the new, shorter setting name: WAGTAILMENUS_CHILDREN_MENU_CLASS.

For example, if you had the following:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings/base.py

    WAGTAILMENUS_CHILDREN_MENU_CLASS_PATH = 'project.menus.CustomChildrenMenu'

You would change this to:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILMENUS_CHILDREN_MENU_CLASS = 'project.menus.CustomChildrenMenu'


The WAGTAILMENUS_SECTION_MENU_CLASS_PATH setting is no longer supported
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using this to override the menu class used to render section menus in your project, you'll need to update your Django settings to use the new, shorter setting name: WAGTAILMENUS_SECTION_MENU_CLASS.

For example, if you had the following:

.. code-block:: python

    # settings/base.py

    WAGTAILMENUS_SECTION_MENU_CLASS_PATH = 'project.menus.CustomSectionMenu'

You would change this to:

.. code-block:: python

    WAGTAILMENUS_SECTION_MENU_CLASS = 'project.app.module.CustomSectionMenu'


The ``wagtailmenus.app_settings`` module has been removed
---------------------------------------------------------

If you're importing this in your project from it's previous location, you should update the import statements in your code to use the new module path: ``wagtailmenus.conf.settings``

For example, instead of the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from wagtailmenus import app_settings

You should do:

.. code-block:: python

    from wagtailmenus.conf import settings


The ``wagtailmenus.constants`` module has been removed
------------------------------------------------------

If you're importing this in your project from it's previous location, you should update the import statements in your code to use the new module path: `` wagtailmenus.conf.constants``

For example, instead of the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from wagtailmenus import constants

You should do:

.. code-block:: python

    from wagtailmenus.conf import constants
