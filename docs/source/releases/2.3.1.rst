Wagtailmenus 2.3.1 release notes
================================

This is a maintenence release to fix to address the following:

* Code example formatting fixes, and better use of headings in README.md.
* Added 'on_delete=models.CASCADE' to all relationship fields on models where
  no 'on_delete' behaviour was previously set (Django 2.0 compatibility).
* Marked a missing string for translation (@einsfr)
* Updated translations for Lithuanian, Portuguese (Brazil), and Russian.
  Many thanks to @mamorim, @treavis and @einsfr!
