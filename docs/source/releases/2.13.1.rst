Wagtailmenus 2.13.1 release notes
=================================

This release includes fixes for the following bugs:

- `#329 <https://github.com/rkhleics/wagtailmenus/issues/329>`_, which prevented level-specific template names working as specified in the docs.
- `#323 <https://github.com/rkhleics/wagtailmenus/issues/323>`_, which prevented ``StreamField`` from working properly when creating or editing menus with custom item models.
