Changelog
=========

1.3.1 (XX.XX.XXXX) IN DEVELOPMENT
---------------------------------

* Extend the 'section matching by path' functionality added in 1.3.0 to
  also identify a 'current page' if the found page matches the exact path.
* Added further tests.
* Reduce the number of unnecessary calls to `Page.specific` in `menu_tags.py`
  where possible.

1.3.0 (06.08.2016)
---------------------------------

* Added the ability for all menu tags to (attempt to) identify ancestor pages
  and section root page by using components from the request path when serving
  a custom URL (not routed via the page tree / served by `wagtail_serve`)
* Added `modify_submenu_items()` method to `MenuPage` model, which takes
  responsibility for modifying the initial menu_items list in `section_menu`
  and `sub_menu` tags. A DRYer approach, that is easier to extend/override to
  meet custom needs.
  

1.2.3 (25.07.2016)
---------------------------------

* Added PyPi version and coveralls test coverage badges to README
* Altered Travis CI test configuration to use tox, allowing for much better
  control over test environments
* Added tests for Python 3.4 and 3.5 to confirm compatibility
* Added CONTRIBUTORS.rst


1.2.2 (06.07.2016)
------------------

 * Added this changelog :)
 * Added `WAGTAILMENUS_SECTION_ROOT_DEPTH` setting support, for more consistent identification of 'section root' pages
